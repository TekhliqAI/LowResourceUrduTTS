### **End-to-End Urdu TTS Using Tacotron2, WaveGlow, and Transfer Learning**

This guide will help you set up an end-to-end Urdu Text-to-Speech (TTS) system using **Tacotron 2** and **WaveGlow** in PyTorch. The process involves adapting the original setup for the Urdu language and ensuring it works with an Urdu corpus.

---

### **Pre-requisites**

1. **NVIDIA GPU + CUDA cuDNN**
2. **Python 3.7+** (Recommended for compatibility with PyTorch)
3. **Install dependencies** (PyTorch, Apex, etc.)

---

### **Setup**

#### 1. **Download and Prepare Urdu Dataset**

- You will need a dataset containing Urdu text and its corresponding audio files (preferably **.wav** files). You can use your custom dataset or search for publicly available Urdu TTS datasets.
  
  For example, a dataset such as the **CommonVoice Urdu** dataset or a custom Urdu speech corpus can be used.

- If the dataset is not in the standard format, make sure it follows the format of having:
  - **Text files** containing transcriptions.
  - **WAV files** with corresponding speech data.
  
  Place the dataset under the folder `urdu_dataset/`.

---

#### 2. **Clone the Tacotron2 Repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2.git
cd tacotron2
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

---

#### 3. **Update Dataset Paths**

Update the paths in the `filelists/*.txt` files to point to your Urdu dataset:

```bash
sed -i -- 's,DUMMY,urdu_dataset_folder/wavs,g' filelists/*.txt
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to load mel-spectrograms from disk instead of WAV files, set `load_mel_from_disk=True` in `hparams.py` and update mel-spectrogram paths.

---

#### 4. **Install Required Dependencies**

1. **Install PyTorch**:

   Make sure you have **PyTorch 1.0+** installed with CUDA support. You can install it via pip:

   ```bash
   pip install torch==1.12.0
   ```

2. **Install Apex** for mixed precision training:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex
   cd apex
   python setup.py install
   ```

3. **Install other Python requirements**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

#### 5. **Training the Urdu TTS Model**

##### Train from Scratch

1. **Run Training**:

   To start training your Tacotron 2 model on the Urdu dataset, use the following command:

   ```bash
   python train.py --output_directory=outdir --log_directory=logdir
   ```

   This will begin training the model from scratch.

##### Train with Pretrained Model (Faster Convergence)

1. **Download Pretrained Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow Models**

   Download the pretrained **Tacotron 2** and **WaveGlow** models from the provided links and place them in your working directory:

   - [Tacotron 2 Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c5ZTuT7J08wLUoVZ2KkUs_VdZuJ86ZqA/view?usp=sharing)
   - [WaveGlow Model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rpK8CzAAirq9sWZhe9nlfvxMF1dRgFbF)

2. **Run with Pretrained Tacotron 2**:

   ```bash
   python train.py --output_directory=outdir --log_directory=logdir -c tacotron2_statedict.pt --warm_start
   ```

---

### **Distributed Training and Mixed Precision**

To train using multiple GPUs and/or automatic mixed precision (AMP):

```bash
python -m multiproc train.py --output_directory=outdir --log_directory=logdir --hparams=distributed_run=True,fp16_run=True
```

This command will enable **distributed** training across multiple GPUs and use **mixed precision** for faster training with reduced memory usage.

---

### **Inference: Running the Model for TTS**

Once the model is trained or you've loaded a pretrained model, you can generate speech from text.

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook for Inference**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook --ip=127.0.0.1 --port=31337
   ```

2. **Load Inference Notebook**:

   Open the notebook `inference.ipynb` inside the repo to test the trained model.

   The notebook will contain instructions to:
   - Load the trained **Tacotron 2** model.
   - Load the **WaveGlow** model for vocoder.
   - Run inference by providing an Urdu text input and generating speech.

---

### **Mel-Spectrogram to Audio Synthesis**

Ensure that the Mel-spectrogram representations used by the **Tacotron 2** model are consistent during training and inference. If the mel-spectrogram representation is different, make sure to preprocess the audio files in the same way.

---

### **Important Notes**

- **Text Preprocessing**: Ensure that the Urdu text is properly tokenized and normalized before feeding it into the model. You might need to implement a custom Urdu text-to-speech preprocessing pipeline to handle Urdu-specific characters and linguistic features (e.g., diacritics, proper handling of Urdu script).
  
- **Training Time**: Training a high-quality TTS model from scratch can take a considerable amount of time, depending on the size of your dataset and the computational resources available. It's highly recommended to use a pre-trained model (e.g., Tacotron 2) and fine-tune it on your specific Urdu dataset.

By following the above steps, you will be able to adapt the **Tacotron 2** and **WaveGlow** system for Urdu TTS with the necessary dataset and customizations. This setup ensures that the model is optimized for low-resource scenarios, leveraging **transfer learning**, **distributed training**, and **automatic mixed precision**.
